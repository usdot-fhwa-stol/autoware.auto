# autoware.auto
This is a fork of AutowareAuto containing modifications to support usage with the [CARMAPlatform](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/carma-platform). This repository contains changes to the AutowareAuto source code and configuration that may not be supported by the Autoware Foundation and may not be consistent with the original design intent of Autoware. All modifications in this repository are licensed under the same Apache License 2.0 as Autoware and all modifications of the source code made will be marked as such in accordance with the terms of the Apache License 2.0. For a list of modifications and their descriptions please see [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).

The next several sections of this readme provide standard information on how this repo relates to the rest of the CARMA project. Below that is the full content of the readme from the master AutowareAuto repo.

[Autoware](https://www.autoware.org/) is the world's first "all-in-one" open-source software for self-driving vehicles hosted under the Autoware Foundation.

The [Autoware.Auto project](https://www.autoware.auto/), based on [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/), is the next generation successor of the [Autoware.AI project](https://www.autoware.ai/), based on [ROS 1](http://wiki.ros.org/Documentation).

Please see [the documentation](https://autowarefoundation.gitlab.io/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/) for all information, including how to build, run, and contribute to Autoware.Auto.

# Repository Structure
This repository consists of multiple git subtrees to combine the multi-repo structure used by AutowareAuto into a single structure for CARMA. For more information on working with subtrees see the [SUBTREES.md](SUBTREES.md) file.

# NOTICE: When working with subtrees please ensure that individual commits only change files in *ONE-AND-ONLY-ONE* subtree.
If your branch must change multiple subtrees please make those changes in separate commits. Do not squash commits that change multiple subtrees, even when merging via Github.
# CARMAPlatform
The primary CARMAPlatform repository can be found [here](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/carma-platform) and is part of the [USDOT FHWA STOL](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/)
github organization. Documentation on how the CARMAPlatform functions, how it will evolve over time, and how you can contribute can be found at the above links as well

## Autoware
[![Autoware](https://www.autoware.ai/static/img/autoware_web_img.png)](https://www.autoware.ai)

[Autoware](https://www.autoware.ai) is the world's first "all-in-one" open-source software for self-driving vehicles. The capabilities of Autoware are primarily well-suited for urban cities, but highways, freeways, mesomountaineous regions, and geofenced areas can be also covered. The code base of Autoware is protected by the Apache 2 License. Please use it at your own discretion. For safe use, we provide a ROSBAG-based simulation environment for those who do not own real autonomous vehicles. If you plan to use Autoware with real autonomous vehicles, **please formulate safety measures and assessment of risk before field testing.**

You may refer to [Autoware Wiki](https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/wiki) for **Users Guide** and **Developers Guide**.

## What Is Autoware

[![Autoware Overview](docs/images/autoware_overview.png)](https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/wiki/Overview)

Autoware provides a rich set of self-driving modules composed of sensing, computing, and actuation capabilities. An overview of those capabilities is described [here](https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/wiki/Overview). Keywords include *Localization, Mapping, Object Detection & Tracking, Traffic Light Recognition, Mission & Motion Planning, Trajectory Generation, Lane Detection & Selection, Vehicle Control, Sensor Fusion, Cameras, LiDARs, RADARs, Deep Learning, Rule-based System, Connected Navigation, Logging, Virtual Reality, and so on*.

## Cloud Services

### Autoware Online

You may test Autoware at [Autoware Online](http://autoware.online/). No need to install the Autoware repository to your local environment.

### Automan

You may annotate and train your ROSBAG data using your web browser through [Automan](https://www.automan.ai). The trained models can be used for deep neural network algorithms in Autoware, such as SSD and Yolo.

### ROSBAG STORE

You may download a number of test and simulation data sets from Tier IV's [ROSBAG STORE](https://rosbag.tier4.jp). Note that free accounts would not allow you to access image data due to privacy matters. 

### Map Tools

You may create 3D map data through Tier IV's [Map Tools](https://maptools.tier4.jp/). The 3D map data used in Autoware are composed of point cloud structure data and vector feature data.
